# Computer Science Quarter 4 Final: Snake Game
Developers: Chhaya Maurya and Liv Morgan
### Game Description
This game is derived from the Google snake game. In this snake game, the user attempts to control the snake and collect food. For every food obtained, the score increases by 1 and the snake's body length increases by 1 as well. The snake can "eat" the food when the two objects collide. The game is over if the snake collides with either the walls of the game or its own body. <br>
